Halo1 Animation Tag Editor

Source code to the tool used for editing animations in H2CE (Halo 2 Custom Edition). Originally released to the public in 2004 http://hce.halomaps.org/index.cfm?fid=577

This is a straight copy of the source code as it appeared on an old HDD. I have not tested it tried recompiling it with modern technology.

Someone seemed to have reverse engineered it and fixed some things here:
